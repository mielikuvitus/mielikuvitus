# Hi, I’m Suvi, a Front-End Engineer pivoting into XR & 3D Web

I’m a front-end engineer with 4+ years of professional experience, now focused on building immersive, interactive experiences across **3D web, WebXR, and XR platforms**.

My background spans large-scale production systems in a banking environment and fast-paced, experimental work in hackathons and XR prototyping. I care deeply about **how people experience technology**, not just how it works.

## Professional Background

**Front-End Engineer — Banking (4 years)**  
- Built and maintained production front-end systems used at scale
- Worked closely with backend developers, product managers, and stakeholders
- Gained strong experience in:
  - front-end architecture
  - maintainability and long-term ownership
  - influencing decisions and advocating for better UX in corporate environments

While I’m no longer pursuing finance as a domain, this experience shaped how I build software **responsibly and collaboratively**.

## Education

**BSc Web Design and Development (First Class Honours)** — **Edinburgh Napier University**  
- Dissertation: *UX of Educational Tools for Universities*
- Foundation for Web Technologies
- Strong foundation in UX research, usability, and human-centred design

## Current Focus

I’m intentionally deepening my technical range in:

- Front-end architecture & advanced JavaScript / TypeScript
- **Three.js** and 3D graphics programming for the browser
- **WebXR** and immersive web experiences
- Building for **Snap Spectacles** using TypeScript
- **Unity** development for Meta / VR platforms

My goal is to work at the intersection of **engineering, interaction, and spatial design** — building experiences that feel intuitive, playful, and technically solid.

## Notes
- Some of my most meaningful work lives in **team repositories** rather than personal ones
- If a repo is private or not yet published, you’ll still find my contributions in my **Pull Requests** history
- More public XR and 3D projects coming soon
